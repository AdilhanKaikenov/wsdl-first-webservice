**WSDL First SOAP Web Service**

Use case:

WSDL First Customer Service will allow the consumers of this Web service to create 
Orders for a given Customer as well as read the Orders for a given Customer.

The steps I have made to develop WSDL First (Top Down) Web Service:
- Create the Project 
  - Create the WSDL 
  - Generate The Stubs (**cxf-codegen-plugin** is used to generate the java stubs)
- Create the endpoint
- Create the config class
- Run the application
